# Reecall Technical Test

## System Architecture

I chose to write this application using **Clean Architecture**.\
Even though it is overkill for a project this size, it creates a system that is highly:

- maintanable
- scalable
- testable

## Application overview

This social application allows users to share posts anonymously.\
It works like a newsletter where users can register with their email to receive updates and publish anonymous posts that will be sent to all the registered emails.

_‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: I intentionally did not implement any authentication or real emailing system as it was going to add complexity without bringing value regarding the evaluation criterias._

## Use cases

### User subscribes to the newsletter

An anonymous user adds its email to the newsletter.\
This will trigger the notification system, sending them a welcome email.

_üõú Emits event : `newSubscribtion`_

### User publishes post

An anonymous user creates a text post.\
This trigger the notification system, sending the post to all the newsletter subscribers.

_üõú Emits event : `postPublished`_

### System broadcast post

The system sends a mail containing a post to all the newsletter subscribers.

_üõú Triggered by : [User publishes post](#user-publishes-post) via notification system listening on `postPublished`_

### System welcome subscriber

The system sends a mail welcoming a subscriber.

_üõú Triggered by : [User subscribes to the newsletter](#user-subscribes-to-the-newsletter) via notification system listening on `newSubscribtion`_

## Running the app

### üê≥ The docker way

([Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) & [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) required)

```bash
docker compose up
```

### ‚úã The manual way

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Run the app

```bash
npm run start
```

## Using the app

The app exposes a RESTful API where :

- `POST` method is used to create
- `GET` method is used to read
- endpoints refer to resources
- data sent or received will always be JSON

### API Reference

#### Add a subscriber to the newsletter

Method: `POST`\
Endpoint: `/subscribers`\
Sample body:

```json
{
  "email": "bob@gmail.com"
}
```

Responses:

- 204 - Request successful, no content returned by the API
- 400 - User error, the API will return a message explaining the error

#### Publish an anonymous post

Method: `POST`\
Endpoint: `/posts`\
Sample body:

```json
{
  "content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
}
```

Responses:
